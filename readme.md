# This is the final project of CS182 in UC Berkeley
This project is about giving an assignment based on the paper: "PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation" https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593

The detials of the assignment can be found in cs182_project.pdf. We provide both assignment handouts and full solution 
of the assignment. The assignment consists of written questions and coding questions. We demonstrated out understanding of 
the paper and the model in this project.

## PointNet Classification
The first part of this assignment is about classifying pointcloud data. We have provided all you need to run this model in classifier_sol.ipynb. The dataset we use is [ModelNet10](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12Mv19pQ84VO8Av50hUXTixSxd5NDjeEB)
The data is automatically downloaded when you run the code.

## PointNet Segmentation
The second paet of this assignment is semantic segmentation of pointcloud data. The implementation is in Segmentation.ipynb.
